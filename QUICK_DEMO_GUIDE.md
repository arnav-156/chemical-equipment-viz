"Here's our Chemical Equipment Visualizer with premium visual effects.

[Login Page]
The login page features a WebGL-powered aurora background with 
flowing gradients and a frosted glass login box.

[Click Features]
Let me show you our features showcase...

[Scroll Stack]
Watch how the cards smoothly stack on top of each other as I scroll.
Each card scales and pins using advanced scroll physics.

[Feature Cards]
We have real-time visualization, ML anomaly detection, 
customizable dashboards, smart alerts, and multi-platform access.

[Final]
All running at 60fps with GPU acceleration. This is production-ready!"
